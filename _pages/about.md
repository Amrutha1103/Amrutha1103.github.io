I specialize as a full-stack roboticist, holding a Master’s degree in Robotics from Northeastern University, Boston, and a Bachelor’s degree in Mechanical Engineering from NIT Surat, India. My research journey has revolved around cutting-edge areas such as robots with various morphologies (snake robots, robot dogs, humanoids), deep learning, reinforcement learning, control systems engineering, computer vision, and mechatronic design.

Driven by a passion for innovation, my goal is to contribute to the development of systems that aid humans in diverse fields like space exploration, disaster response operations, manufacturing, and beyond. If you share similar interests, I’d be delighted to connect and discuss further. Let’s explore the possibilities together!
