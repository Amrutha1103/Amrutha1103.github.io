I am a data science professional with a Master’s degree in Computer Engineering specializing in Information Systems from Northeastern University, Boston, and a Bachelor’s degree in Electronics and Communication Engineering from Jawaharlal Nehru Technological University, Hyderabad. My expertise spans data science, database design, application engineering, and web design, with a strong foundation in programming languages such as Python, SQL, and JavaScript, and tools like Scikit-Learn, TensorFlow, Tableau, and MongoDB.

My professional experience as an Application Development Analyst at Accenture involved managing data flows, developing ad-hoc queries, and facilitating KPI reporting. I successfully improved system accuracy and performance and significantly reduced error rates. I have led projects in abstract summarization, sentiment analysis, and data analysis, demonstrating my ability to apply advanced data engineering techniques to solve complex problems.
