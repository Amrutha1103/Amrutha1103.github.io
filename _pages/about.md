I am a robotics engineer with a Master’s degree in Robotics from Northeastern University, Boston, and a Bachelor’s degree in Mechanical Engineering from NIT Surat, India. My expertise spans deep learning, reinforcement learning, control systems engineering, computer vision, and mechatronic design. I have extensive experience working with diverse robotic morphologies, including snake robots, robot dogs, and humanoids.

Driven by a passion for innovation, my goal is to contribute to the development of systems that aid humans in diverse fields like space exploration, disaster response operations, manufacturing, and beyond. If you share similar interests, I’d be delighted to connect and discuss further. Let’s explore the possibilities together!
