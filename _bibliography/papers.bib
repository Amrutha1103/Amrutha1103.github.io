  title={Reinforcement Learning-Based Model Matching in COBRA, a Slithering Snake Robot},
  author={Nallaguntla, Harin Kumar},
  abstract={This work employs a reinforcement learning-based model identification method aimed at enhancing the accuracy of the dynamics for our snake robot, called COBRA. Leveraging gradient information and iterative optimization, the proposed approach refines the parameters of COBRAâ€™s dynamical model such as coefficient of friction and actuator parameters using experimental and simulated data. Experimental validation on the hardware platform demonstrates the efficacy of the proposed approach, highlighting its potential to address sim-to-real gap in robot implementation.},
