title: Reinforcement Learning-Based Model Matching in COBRA, a Slithering Snake Robot
description: Here is a concise overview of the key ideas and findings from my thesis. Condensing a year's worth of brainstorming, programming, testing, reading, and writing into a single blog post is challenging, but I have done my best to capture the essence here.

## Simualtion-to-Reality Gap

Developing effective locomotion controllers for mobile robots is challenging, and while Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) offers promising solutions, it requires impractical amounts of training data for high-risk tasks like locomotion and manipulation. Although computer simulations provide a safe and efficient training environment, the resulting policies often fail to transfer effectively to real hardware due to the "Simulation-to-Reality Gap" (sim2real gap), caused by discrepancies such as differences in friction, joint dynamics, and sensor noise between simulated and real environments. These discrepancies impede the transition of control policies from simulation to real-world applications, resulting in suboptimal performance and limited generalization of robotic systems.
